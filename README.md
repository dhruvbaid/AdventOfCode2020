# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for the Advent of Code event (2020)

I am on the UChicago Leaderboard!

Update: After Day 19, which is the day when I needed to search for solutions
online, I have stopped competing on the UChicago Leaderboard. I feel like it is
not fair to others when I owe my leaderboard position to solutions I found
online. I will continue solving the problems, but it will no longer be a timed
competition for me. Hopefully, I will come back stronger next year! It was a
great run thus far, and I am very pleasantly surprised by the results I have
managed to obtain.
