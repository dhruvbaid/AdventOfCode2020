# AdventOfCode2020
My solutions for the Advent of Code event (2020)

I am on the UChicago Leaderboard!

Update: I have reached my limit around Day 20 - that is when I needed to search
for solutions online. I will continue competing, but the solutions I presented
here for Days 19 onwards are not necessarily entirely my own; I have cited my
sources wherever appropriate. I will continue solving the challenges for the 5
days which remain, and hopefully will come back stronger next year! It was a
great run thus far, and I am very pleasantly surprised by the results I have
managed to obtain.
